# javascript-only-tetris


Tetris game, written a long time ago in pure JS. 

All that is needed is to open the htm in a browser (a modern browser, I didn't even care to test on IE6...)

PS : The fact that when you click on the down key the piece falls faster even when you stop pressing the key is not an issue, it's a feature. It's something which always bothered me with the original game : if I press down I'm sure the piece is falling where I neeed it to be, I don't need to stop pressing to readjust!).
